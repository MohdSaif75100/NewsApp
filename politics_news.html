   <p><b>The Maharashtra Legislative Council was adjourned for the day on Monday after heated arguments between the BJP and Opposition Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) legislators over Leader of Opposition Rahul Gandhi’s dig at the BJP in the Lok Sabha that those who call themselves Hindus are engaged in “violence and hate”.

    The issue rocked the state Legislative Council with BJP legislators demanding that a resolution be passed in the Council and sent to the Lok Sabha condemning Rahul.
    
    Later in the evening, Deputy Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis said, “Congress leader Rahul Gandhi’s remark against Hindus is highly objectionable. Calling the entire community violent cannot be tolerated as it demeans an entire community, which has believed in non-violence. Rahul Gandhi should apologise to the entire Hindu community in the Lok Sabha.”</b></p>
